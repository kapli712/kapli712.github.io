I am 19 years old and I use she/her pronouns. I'm looking forward to learn more about coding and continuing to improve myself. I love New York and I have missed Parsons very much. I am passionate about advertising and branding.

Coding seems hard to do and I am a slow learner :)

The thing I'm most looking forward to once it's safe: is to party all night and hang out with my grandparents
